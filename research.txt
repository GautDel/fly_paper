very time you show a joke, store it in your database as "shown".
Store a value in your database for the last day you selected a joke.
Write a function that pulls that date from the database and stores it in memory.
Whenever you render the page, check if the current date is different from
the saved "last time I selected a joke" date. If so, pull a new joke from the
database which isn't saved as "shown", update its metadata to indicate that it's
been shown, and present that joke. Update your cache with today's date and the
joke you want to show there are lots of ways to do it. You could write a script
to update the metadata for each joke in your database with a "display date" that
goes up by 1 for each joke, then just pass the current date into your request for
the joke to look it up by date. that would be another way
